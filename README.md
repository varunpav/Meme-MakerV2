# Meme Maker

## Description
Meme Maker is a full-stack web application that allows users to create custom memes. It uses a Python Flask backend for handling image operations and a React.js frontend for a dynamic user experience. Users can upload images, add customizable text, and save or share their creations.

Originally created using Java and a simple JPanel GUI, it was repurposed for the sake of allowing others to use the app. 

Personally, I use it to take pictures of friends doing something dumb and captioning the picture with something even dumber.
