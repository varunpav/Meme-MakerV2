# Meme Maker

## Description
Meme Maker is a full-stack web application that allows users to create custom memes. It uses a Python Flask backend for handling image operations and a React.js frontend for a dynamic user experience. Users can upload images, add customizable text, and save or share their creations. Personally, I use it to take pictures of friends doing something dumb and captioning the picture with something even dumber.

Originally created using Java and a simple JPanel GUI, it was repurposed for the sake of allowing others to use the app. I was actually interviewing for a SWE intern role at MITRE where an interviewer asked me about Meme Magic - A class project at UVA for CS 2110 (repo on my page) and if I were to repurpose it what tech stack I would use. I am very new to Flask and am taking it one step at a time whenever free so updates may be a bit infrequent but I intend to finish this side project.
